  - Users can upload educational resources and set an access price for others to view or use the content.
- **Purchase Access**:
  - Users can purchase access to educational resources by paying the set access price, with earnings directly benefiting the uploader.

## Future Scope

1. **Resource Rating System**:

   - Implement a rating system for users to provide feedback on educational resources, ensuring content quality.

2. **Subscription Model**:

   - Introduce subscription-based access to resources, where users can pay a recurring fee to access multiple resources.

3. **Collaborative Content Creation**:
   - Allow multiple creators to collaborate on resources and share the earnings proportionally.

The **DecentralizedLibrary** contract encourages the sharing and monetization of educational content in a decentralized environment, promoting fair and direct compensation for content creators.
